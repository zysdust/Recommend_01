You've found the dress you're looking for. This is tops! Quality matches price! \n\nAbout me: I am 5'8' and 141 lbs. I have an athletic body, longer torso, shorter legs. \n\nRE: FIT/STRETCH. Because there is no stretch it this at all, this fits true to size. So, if you are a 4/6 girl (like me), order the 6. Whereas, if you're a 4/6 girl and you've been watching those sweets for a couple weeks, then you'll be able to wear the 4.  I ordered both!  I was worried I wouldn't be able to sit in this, but I was able to sit just fine, in both the 4 and 6.  I was \"worried\" that the sleeves wouldn't fit my arms (I do back/bi and chest/tri every week), yet the sleeves were fit perfectly!\n\nRE: LENGTH/SEXINESS. I felt that the dress was appropriately long. By today's trends, most gals would say it's way too long. And in fact, it would probably be too long for a petite woman. However, for my Bridal Shower, it really made a lovely statement, by being sexy (with it's illusion top and glittery \"burnt\" rose gold) without being too sexy (appropriate length, covered chest).  From the pictures, you can tell that I am very, very, very pale. The illusion netting was a different color from my skin, but I didn't mind one bit. If that's a concern of yours, you can always wear panty hose to match. \n\nRE: ACCESSORIES: I wore dainty drop pink pearl earrings and matching bracelet and my engagement ring. My shoes were plain nude peep-toe pumps.\n", "body type": "athletic", "review_summary": "Bridal Party Show Stopper! <3 ", "category": "sheath", "height": "5' 8\"", "size": 8, "age": "28", "review_date": "December 4, 2016"}

If you just need to sit and look pretty then it'll probably be fine. Other wise the dress was really pretty and I received a lot of compliments.
